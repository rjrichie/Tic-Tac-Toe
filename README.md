# Tic-Tac-Toe

Just a small project creating a simple tic tac toe game that can be played on the terminal.

The game has three game modes and playable on n x n grid.

1. Player vs Player
2. Player vs Bot (Easy)
3. Player vs Bot (Hard)

The Easy Bot chooses the move randomly, whereas the Hard Bot chooses the best move possible by using Alpha-Beta-Pruning. The worst outcome for the Hard Bot is a draw, if we play our best moves. If we don't play our best move, there is a chance for the Bot to win.

If there are any issues. Please be sure to report them and I will be willingly to fix it.
